# Exercises

1. **What is an Event?**
    - Create a simple HTML page with a button. Write a JavaScript function that listens for the button's click event and logs a message to the console when the button is clicked.
    - Add an event listener to an input field that logs the input value whenever it changes.
    - Create a script that listens for the **`DOMContentLoaded`** event and logs a message when the page has finished loading.
2. **Types of Events**
    - Write a script that listens for **`mouseover`** and **`mouseout`** events on a specific element and changes its background color accordingly.
    - Create a simple form with a submit button. Add a submit event listener to the form that prevents the default form submission and logs the form data to the console.
3. **Accessing the event information**
    - Write a script that listens for the **`mousemove`** event and logs the current mouse coordinates (clientX and clientY) to the console.
    - Implement a function that listens for the **`keydown`** event and logs the key code and whether the Shift, Ctrl, or Alt key was pressed (use the **`event.shiftKey`**, **`event.ctrlKey`**, and **`event.altKey`** properties).
